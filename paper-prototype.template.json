This is a low-fidelity, tangible model of our product that we can interact with.\n\n---\n\n## Components 📋\n\n**Screens** 🖥️\n\n*   Draw the main screens of your product. Include key elements like menus, buttons, images, and text fields.\n\n**User Interactions** 👆\n\n*   Use arrows or notes to indicate how a user would interact with each screen. This could include clicking a button, scrolling down, or entering text.\n\n**Transitions** 🔄\n\n*   Show what happens when a user interacts with a screen. This could be a new screen, a pop-up, or a change in the current screen.\n\n**Notes** 📝\n\n*   Add any additional notes or explanations to provide context or clarify how something should work.\n\n---\n\n## Guidelines 📚\n\n*   **Keep it simple** 🧘: Your drawings don't need to be perfect. The goal is to communicate your ideas effectively.\n*   **Focus on the user experience** 👥: Think about how a user would interact with your product and what they would expect to happen.\n*   **Iterate quickly** 🔁: One of the benefits of paper prototyping is that you can make changes quickly. Don't be afraid to try out different ideas.\n\n---\n\n## Resources 📚\n\n*   Paper\n*   Pens or Pencils\n*   Sticky Notes\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion 🏁\n\nThank you for your participation in creating this Paper Prototype. This is a tangible representation of our product that we can use to test and improve our ideas. Let's continue to iterate and refine!\n\n---\n\nRemember, this is just a template. Feel free to modify it to suit your needs. Happy prototyping! 🎉"}]}
